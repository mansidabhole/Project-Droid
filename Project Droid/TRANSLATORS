First of all, thank you very much!


This is not that big of a project, so once the initial translation has been done, don't
expect a lot of work. I add your name and email to the list of translators, this file
is world readable, if you don't want this, clearly state this in all communication with
me. I might contact you when I'm close to a new release that contains a lot of
translation changes. But don't count on it, so if you notice a new release or notice a
translation error, don't hesitate to send me a pull request.

Help with translating
=====================
The changes are marked with a + (addition), - (removal) or * (change).
The default file is in SwiFTP/res/values/strings.xml. If you would for instance
translated to dutch, you would need to create a new file SwiFTP/res/values-nl/strings.xml
that file should contain the same contents as the default file, but the strings must be
translated in dutch. The language codes are available at
http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php .
Translations are preferable done on github. You fork the code, make the changes
and send me a pull request. I believe github has tools to make small file changes
in the browser and then send pull request, you might need to read up on this.
